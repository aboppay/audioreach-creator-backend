 *                     Crash-safe: reserved IDs are persisted upfront and
 *                     will never be reissued even if the import fails.
 *                     Call explicitly for bulk operations (e.g. open-file)
 *                     to pre-reserve a large block and avoid repeated
 *                     auto-reserve DB calls.
 *
 *   getNextId()     — async; hands out IDs from the in-memory block.
 *                     Transparently auto-reserves a new block (autoReserveSize
 *                     IDs, default 100) when the current block is exhausted or
 *                     no block has been reserved yet.
 *                     Concurrent calls that arrive while a reserve is in-flight
 *                     are coalesced onto the same DB round-trip.
 *
 *   persistActual() — writes the actual last-used ID back to the DB,
 *                     reclaiming any unused tail of the reserved block.
